CAUTION : I was done this assignment at linux(ubuntu). So, I recommend that my assignment is tested at linux enviroment.

Notice 1:
>> I split my code into 'Dictionary.cpp' , 'Hash.h', 'Hash.cpp' as stated below.
So, for linking convenience, I make 'Makefile'.
If my executuon file make some noise, recommend enter command [make] for re-compiling.

Notice 2:
>> I use 'chart.cpp' for drawing chart of top 20 most frequent words.
I already compile this file, so if you want print chart, enter command [./chart].
Also I copy this chart at my output file.
